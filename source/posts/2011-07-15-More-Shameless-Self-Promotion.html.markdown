Hi all.  As a small gift for you going into this weekend, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/happy-square-prime-sandwich-day-1072/">here</a>'s a link to an article from The Numbers Guy at the Wall Street Journal.  I was one of several people interviewed for my thoughts on the preponderance of math holidays that have been in the news recently.  If you've been reading this blog for a while, you will already know my general feelings towards these holidays.  More details, though, can be found <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/03/square-root-day.html">here</a> or <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/04/numerology-goes-on-holiday-again.html">here</a>.  If you're curious, you can probably find other articles in which I jump on the soapbox.

I'll be back next week with something more substantive.  In the meantime, enjoy your weekend, and if you're in Los Angeles, Happy Carmageddon!
