<div style="text-align: justify;">I admire the food blog Serious Eats because, as we've seen <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2008/12/math-gets-around-holiday-treats.html">before</a>, it's not afraid to get a little mathematical.  This month they have upped the ante with a post on the delicious object now known as the <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/12/coolest-thing-weve-ever-seen-mobius-strip-bagel-cut-connected-halves.html">Mobius strip bagel</a>.<br /></div><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel0.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 314px; height: 230px;" src="http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Named for the classical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip">geometric object</a> of the same name, the Mobius strip bagel (and its cousin, the <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/12/even-cooler-the-mobius-doughnut.html">Mobius strip donut</a>) give an elegant mathematical spin on ordinary edibles.  In addition to the aesthetic value, the Mobius strip bagel also has the advantage of added surface area, meaning that one can pile on even more cream cheese before stuffing one's face.<br /><br />Mathematician George Hart has step-by-step instructions for the transformation from torus to Mobius strip <a href="http://www.georgehart.com/bagel/bagel.html">here</a>.  I have yet to try this technique myself, but I can think of no better way to celebrate the holidays than by transforming breakfast food into mathematically themed breakfast food.<br /></div>
