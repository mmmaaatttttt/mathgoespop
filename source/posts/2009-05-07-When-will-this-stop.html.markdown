Ok, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090507/ap_on_fe_st/us_odd_odd_day;_ylt=AtKS0Q_qX0MsIrr0r_9cxNcDW7oF">now</a> it's just getting annoying.  Odd day?  Give me a break.

My thoughts on this irritating trend can be found <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/03/square-root-day.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/03/pi-day.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/04/numerology-goes-on-holiday-again.html">here</a>.
