<div style="text-align: justify;">Apologies for my absence - academic life has recently forced me to put the blog on hold.  Things have cleared up now though, and I have a backlog of things to discuss, so let's get right to it.<br /></div><br />Last month, Jennie <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Yabroff</span> wrote an <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/221389">article</a> for Newsweek discussing the new film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0929632/">Precious</a>.  I haven't seen the film, but this trailer makes a fairly strong impression:<br /><br /><center><object width="440" height="270"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/rx-3jYJkUWQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/rx-3jYJkUWQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="440" height="270"></embed></object></center><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The film has received a nearly unanimous positive response from critics.  The main character, Precious, begins the film as a 16 year-old illiterate middle school student, but after transferring to an alternative school, she is able to find hope with the help of a teacher who encourages her to keep a journal and write in it daily.<br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />The theme of finding redemption through writing is certainly not new to this genre of film, as <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Yabroff</span> points out.  Films such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112792/">Dangerous Minds</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463998/">Freedom Writers</a> have explored this territory before, although perhaps with less success than Precious.  However, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Yabroff</span> wonders if all this time spent <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">journaling</span> wouldn't be better spent learning some mathematics.<br /><br />In her article, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Yabroff</span> writes:<br /><blockquote>The idea that every underprivileged young adult harbors the soul of a Rimbaud is a favorite trope of popular culture. We don't expect our bankers and lawyers to be secret <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Baudelaires</span>, but we eagerly accept the idea that every poor person has a "story," and just needs the right teacher or mentor to give it voice...<br /><br />...But, contrary to what Hollywood would have us believe, the world does not reward self-expression as readily or consistently as it rewards a good head for numbers. It's hard for any writer to support herself writing. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">Precious's</span> teacher should have known that, and given her a calculator along with that journal.</blockquote><br /><a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2008/07/math-in-movies-stand-and-deliver.html">Stand and Deliver</a> is one film that shows how mathematics can improve the lives of inner city youths, but as a general rule it does seem much more likely that a film will attempt to highlight the potential of students through writing rather than through math.  Part of this bias is to be expected, since, as <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">Yabroff</span> points out, movies are written by writers and not mathematicians.  Also, given <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">Precious's</span> illiteracy, it would make more sense to build up her fundamental reading and writing skills before asking her to pick up a math book.  Even so, should we be concerned that nearly every film that shows inner city youth turning their lives around does it by emphasizing words over equations?<br /><br />One may be tempted to argue that it's just harder to write a film that portrays math honestly and in a compelling way, but I think that's only true if you're a lazy writer or you don't know anything about math.  Especially at the high school level, the fundamental concepts could be explained in a way that's understandable to general audience, and, dare I say it, even interesting.  The end result may not seem to be as glamorous if one's education is focused on math - given the choice, I'm guessing that kids would rather be like <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">Kanye</span> instead of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">Urkel</span> - but this just means we need to do a better job showing kids why mathematical skills are so attractive.<br /><br />I for one would love to see more movies like Stand and Deliver, especially ones that follow through and show what can be done with a background in science and math.  Who knows when that will happen, though.  I guess we need a character with the technical know-how of Steve <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">Urkel</span>, but the charm and sophistication of is suave doppelganger, Stephan <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">Urquelle</span>.  I am confident that character is out there, and am hopeful that his (or her) time will soon come.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fM0L9abY3bo/Sx7YxtJNZtI/AAAAAAAAATk/4a6puzINBzU/s1600-h/steve-urkel-2-241x350.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 220px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fM0L9abY3bo/Sx7YxtJNZtI/AAAAAAAAATk/4a6puzINBzU/s320/steve-urkel-2-241x350.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5413002150589327058" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:78%;">Sorry Steve - lose the suspenders, and then we can talk.</span><br /></div></div>
