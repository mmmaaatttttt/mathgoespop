Now that baseball season has ended, I find myself going through withdrawal. And with spring training several months away, I need something to fill the void left in my heart. To that end, let's take a moment and look back -- with a mathematical eye, of course -- on the 2015 World Series.

In case you missed it, Game 1 of the World Series was a game for the ages. The New York Mets and the Kansas City Royals duked it out for 14 innings. This was long enough to take the crown for the longest Game 1 in World Series history (though it tied Game 2 in 1916 and Game 3 in 2005, which were also 14 innings long). Here are the highlights:

Even before Game 1, many pundits predicted that the series would last a full seven games. For example, all 5 members of the CBS Sports staff polled in <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/25351815/2015-world-series-predictions-mets-royals-go-the-distance" target="_blank">this</a> article predicted a seven-game series, though they were split on which team would emerge victorious.

It shouldn't be surprising, then, that after Game 1 analysts maintained their faith that the series would be a long one. And at the time, this belief seemed entirely reasonable: if two teams are so evenly matched that they can duel each other for 14 innings, then surely the series should be more likely than average to last seven games. Even bookies agreed with this assessment; here's how the odds for World Series betting changed between Game 1 and Game 2 (courtesy of <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2583362-world-series-2015-odds-and-prop-bets-info-for-mets-vs-royals-game-1" target="_blank">Bleacher</a> <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2583670-world-series-2015-odds-prop-bets-score-prediction-for-mets-vs-royals-game-2">Report</a>):

(Here, the percent change is calculated with respect to a $1 bet. For instance, a $1 bet on a four game series before Game 1 would've earned you $19/4 = $4.75, but after Game 1 and before Game 2 it would've earned $7.50, a roughly 58% increase.) 

Note that odds on a seven game series had the biggest downward change after Game 1, reflecting the fact that more people thought a seven-game series was likely. It was somewhat surprising, then, when the Royals defeated the Mets in only five games.

This raises an interesting question: are extra-innings games actually any good at predicting how long a world series lasts?
