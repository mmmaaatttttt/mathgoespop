Not <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090705/od_afp/britainoffbeat;_ylt=AvlPmFpsvyUGr9NMu_t1JD4DW7oF">this</a> again.  I've now discovered that the mastermind behind these so-called math "holidays" is a teacher named Ron Gordon.  Not only was he the one to spearhead the <a href="http://mathgoespop.blogspot.com/2009/05/when-will-this-stop.html">Odd Day</a> initiative 2 months ago, but he's gone so far as to double dip and call today Odd Day as well, citing the fact that standard date notation for most of the world is DD/MM/YY, rather than MM/DD/YY.<br /><br />Thanks for double dipping, Mr. Gordon, so that I can read these pointless articles yet again.   Mr. Gordon has even set up a web page and a contest, with cash prizes for those who can celebrate Odd Day the most enthusiastically.  Needless to say, I don't think I will be the recipient of any such prize.<br /><br />The road to hell is paved with good intentions, Mr. Gordon.  I'm just sayin'.
