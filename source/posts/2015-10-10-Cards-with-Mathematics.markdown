I'm a sucker for a good card game. Or even a bad card game, if it's played in the company of good friends. Or even a bad card game if it's played in the company of poor friends, as long as the food is decent.

What I mean to say is, I've played a variety of card games in my day. Some of them, as you may know, can spark some interesting mathematics. If you've taken a probability course, for instance, you may have explored the intersection of cards and mathematics a bit. Maybe you had to calculate the probability of being dealt a full house in poker, or of busting in a game of blackjack.

But mathematics exists even in card games that don't typically come up in math class. And just because a deck of cards doesn't have any numbers on it, that doesn't mean it should be exiled into the realm of the non-mathematical.

To prove this point, consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cards_Against_Humanity" target="_blank">_Cards Against Humanity_</a> (or, if you'd prefer, its more family-friendly predecessor: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_to_Apples" target="_blank">_Apples to Apples_</a>). Rather than the describe the rules of _Cards Against Humanity_, a self-described "party game for horrible people," let's work through a practice round of the game together.

To play the game, each player starts with a certain number of white cards (the exact number depends on how many people are playing). Each round, one player (dubbed the Grand Czar, a role that rotates from round to round) takes a black card from the deck and turns it over. Here's an example; click on the card below to flip it:

<div class="card question">
  <div class="card-front"></div>
  <div class="card-back">

  </div>
</div>

Once the black card has been revealed, players try to find the white card in their hand that they think pairs best with the Czar's black card. Once all players have submitted their responses, they're shuffled and the Czar decides which response he or she likes best. The winner receives the black card (so that people can keep track of how many rounds they've won), and the game proceeds to the next round.

To keep things simple, suppose you have three cards in your hand. In response to the prompt above, which one would you choose? (Remember: click to flip!)

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-4">
		<div class="card answer">
		  <div class="card-front"></div>
		  <div class="card-back">
		    <img src="/images/2015/10/white-card-1.png" alt="What's the next Happy Meal Toy?">
		  </div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">
		<div class="card answer">
		  <div class="card-front"></div>
		  <div class="card-back">
		    <img src="/images/2015/10/white-card-2.png" alt="What's the next Happy Meal Toy?">
		  </div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">
		<div class="card answer">

	</div>
