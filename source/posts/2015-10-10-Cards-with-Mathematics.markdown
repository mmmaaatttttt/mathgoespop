I'm a sucker for a good card game. Or even a bad card game, if it's played in the company of good friends. Or even a bad card game if it's played in the company of poor friends, as long as the food is decent.

What I mean to say is, I've played a variety of card games in my day. Some of them, as you may know, can spark some interesting mathematics. If you've taken a probability course, for instance, you may have explored the intersection of cards and mathematics a bit. Maybe you had to calculate the probability of being dealt a full house in poker, or of busting in a game of blackjack.

But mathematics exists even in card games that don't typically come up in math class. And just because a deck of cards doesn't have any numbers on it, that doesn't mean it should be exiled into the realm of the non-mathematical.

To prove this point, consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cards_Against_Humanity" target="_blank">_Cards Against Humanity_</a> (or, if you'd prefer, its more family-friendly predecessor: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_to_Apples" target="_blank">_Apples to Apples_</a>). In _Cards Against Humanity_, a self-described "party game for horrible people," each player has a set of cards. Each card has a word or phrase on it. In each round, the goal is to select the card in your hand which you feel best fits the prompt for that round. 

If this sounds confusing, it's because the game is best understood by playing it for yourself. Here's a practice round: click on the card below to flip it over:
