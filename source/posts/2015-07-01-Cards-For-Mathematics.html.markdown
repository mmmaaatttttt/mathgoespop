I love a good game night. There are few things I enjoy more than breaking bread with good friends before settling in for an evening of structured play. And even though I'm a child of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" target="_blank">NES</a> generation, some of the best game nights I've had have involved games that don't require electricity.

Many of these analog games have been _card_ games. As a doe-eyed twentysomething, one of the more popular card games in my circle was Apples to Apples.
