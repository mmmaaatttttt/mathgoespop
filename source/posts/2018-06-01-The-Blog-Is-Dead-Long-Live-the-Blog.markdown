Hello friends,

As you may have noticed, this little corner of the internet hasn't seen a lot of activity lately. The bad news is that I've decided to wind this blog down. The good news is that I've got a new home on the internet! You can check out my latest writing [here](https://mattlane.us). I've been writing one story every month or so, and I'd love to know what you think.

Why the change? Here are a few reasons:

1.  I started this project as a graduate student a decade ago. At the time, I wanted an outlet to share interesting mathematical ideas with an audience that might not otherwise be exposed to them. Pop culture seemed like a natural way to explore these ideas for a general audience. However, as time has passed, I've found myself wanting to write about mathematics in ways that aren't always tied to popular culture. So the theme of this blog has become a little restrictive.

    Don't worry - I'll still write about the intersection of math and pop culture. But I'd like to write about other things as well.

2.  When I started this blog 10 years ago, I sort of knew how to write, but I didn't know much about coding or creating fun data visualizations. Since then I've transitioned from academia into web development, and now teach other people how to code at [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/). These skills let me create much more dynamic and interactive ways to tell the stories I'd like to tell. But this site is somewhat hobbled by technologies I'm not as interested in. Rather than port all of these posts to a new set of technologies, I'd prefer a clean slate.

3.  I'd like to think that I've matured as a writer over the past decade. Some of these posts definitely make me cringe a little. I'd like to think I'm a bit more earnest these days, and a little less snarky. But I'll let you be the judge of that.

Anyway, I hope you'll continue reading what I have to say. Thanks!
