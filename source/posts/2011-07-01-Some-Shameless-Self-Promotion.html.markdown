Looking for a way to procrastinate before the three day weekend?  Then feel free to check out <a href="http://jmle.org/blog/?p=274">this</a> interview I gave to the Journal of Media Literacy Education.  I gave the interview some time ago, but just happened to stumble upon it in published form this week.  If you want some behind-the-scenes perspective into how this blog started, and my general philosophy behind writing it, this interview is a good place to start.

Hope the long weekend treats you well!
