Hi everyone,

A while back I was asked to contribute an essay to a book on mathematics and popular culture.  I'm pleased to announce that this <a href="http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4978-1">book</a> is now available for purchase!  There are some great essays in this book - I'll let you decide how mine stacks up with the rest - and it also features a foreword by <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~kdevlin/">Keith Devlin</a>, a Stanford University mathematician who you may know as NPR's Math Guy.

The price of entry is a little steep ($45), but if you're someone interested in buying many copies (maybe you are a teacher, or maybe you just have a huge crush on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Krumholtz">David Krumholtz</a>), I can get you a discount on bulk orders.

To whet your appetite, the title of my essay is <em>Counting with the Sharks: Math-Savvy Gamblers in Popular Culture</em>.  Here's the abstract:
<blockquote>While mathematicians in pop culture are often portrayed as misanthropic savants who may or may not be insane, films like <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(2008_film)">21</a></em> have helped usher in a new stereotype: the math-whiz card shark.  We explore the origin and development of this stereotype through films such as <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_Man">Rain Man</a></em> and <em>21</em>, as well as its appearance in TV shows such as <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numb3rs">Numb3rs</a></em> and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Months_2_Million">2 Months, $2 Million</a></em>.  We also discuss the pros and cons of this stereotype relative to the more traditional one.</blockquote>
In the coming months, I may use some of the other essays in this collection as a springboard for a couple of posts here.  So stay tuned!
