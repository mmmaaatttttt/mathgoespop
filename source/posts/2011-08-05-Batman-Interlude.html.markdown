Hi everyone.  Apologies for flying under the radar lately.  I am getting married soon, and along with life's usual habit of getting in the way, preparations are surprisingly time consuming.

Having said that, I have a couple of articles in the pipeline specifically addressing the intersection of mathematics and weddings (the intersection is non-empty, I assure you).  In the meantime, if you're looking for a mathematical fix, you need look no further than <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/29/batman-logo-in-equation-form.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+boingboing%2FiBag+%28Boing+Boing%29">this</a> link, which gives an explicit function whose graph bears a striking resemblance to the Batman logo.  Mathematicians who need to contact crime fighters need no longer live in fear.

Want to see your favorite superhero's logo memorialized in the Cartesian coordinate plane?  Give it a shot!

I'll be back soon with some more substantial content.  Hat tip to Nate for the link to this crime-reducing function.
