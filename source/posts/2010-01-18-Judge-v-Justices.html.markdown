Just as you can't judge a book by its cover, it is not always easy to determine a person's mathematical background based on his or her occupation.  Sure, a burger flipper at McDonald's may not look like the next Einstein, but how can you be sure she's not just working a summer job to afford university?  Conversely, just because someone is highly educated doesn't mean he knows the difference between a prime and a composite number (although I'd argue that it should).

Case in point: Supreme Court justices may or may not know the meaning of the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality">orthogonal</a>.  Here's a snippet from the oral arguments in the case of Briscoe v. Virginia (courtesy of blog <a href="http://volokh.com/2010/01/11/orthogonal-ooh/">The Volokh Conspiracy</a>):

<blockquote>
<p>MR. FRIEDMAN: I think that issue is entirely orthogonal to the issue here because the Commonwealth is acknowledging -</p>
<p>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I’m sorry. Entirely what?</p>
<p>MR. FRIEDMAN: Orthogonal. Right angle.  Unrelated. Irrelevant.</p>
<p>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh.</p>
<p>JUSTICE SCALIA: What was that adjective? I liked that.</p>
<p>MR. FRIEDMAN: Orthogonal.</p>
<p>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Orthogonal.</p>
<p>MR. FRIEDMAN: Right, right.</p>
<p>JUSTICE SCALIA: Orthogonal, ooh.</p>
<p>(Laughter.)</p>
<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY: I knew this case presented us a problem.</p>
<p>(Laughter.)</p>
<p>MR. FRIEDMAN: I should have — I probably should have said -</p>
<p>JUSTICE SCALIA: I think we should use that in the opinion.</p>
<p>(Laughter.)</p>
<p>MR. FRIEDMAN: I thought — I thought I had seen it before.</p>
<p>JUSTICE SCALIA: Or the dissent.</p>
<p>(Laughter.)</p>
<p>MR. FRIEDMAN: That is a bit of professorship creeping in, I suppose.</p>
</blockquote>

While Friedman uses "orthogonal" in a bit of a metaphorical sense, this use is far from unprecedented - indeed, this use is even documented in the venerable internet database <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=orthogonal">ubrandictionary.com</a>, which defines orthogonal as a term that is "used to describe two things that are independent of one another.  One does not imply the other."  Claiming that this usage is just a "bit of professorship" sounds a bit like a cop out.  I wish Friedman had embraced it more completely.

In any event, the mathematical definition of orthogonal should be given in any halfway decent high school geometry course, if only as a synonym for perpendicular.  The fact that Scalia and Roberts seem so unfamiliar with the concept is, at the very least, a little disappointing.

But all is not lost.  On the other hand, last weekend Fox aired a special commemorating 20 years of The Simpsons, appropriately titled <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/119821/the-simpsons-anniversary-special-in-3-d-on-ice">The Simpsons Anniversary Special: In 3-D! On Ice!</a>.  Several people contributed interviews to the special, including Mike Judge, creater of <span style="font-style: italic;">Beavis and Butthead</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">King of the Hill</span>, among other comedic gems.  During the interview, Judge dropped a bombshell: were it not for <em>The Simpsons</em>, he believes he would be a math teacher.  In fact, after doing some research online, I discovered that Judge didn't begin playing with animation until the age of 26, while he was doing graduate studies in mathematics in the hopes of becoming a teacher.

Does this mean that Beavis and Butthead are smarter than Roberts and Scalia?  Of course, some may cry out that this is an unfair comparison, but I think I can provide a fair answer.
