Hello gentle reader.  This week is a bit hectic for me, so I don't have time for a proper update.  But what with it being Leap Day and all, I thought it only appropriate to share some kind of gift with you.

If you have the time, below is an excellent documentary from the 90's on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_Last_Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles">Andrew Wiles</a>, the man who set his sights on proving it.  It's a great documentary, and may have somewhat blown my mind when I first saw it as a high school student.  So take some time out from your Leap Day (it is a bonus block of 24 hours, after all) and check it out!
