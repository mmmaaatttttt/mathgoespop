Hi everyone,

If you follow me on Twitter, you may have noticed some activity over the past week in regards to a new Kickstarter project, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mathalicious/math52-a-fresh-way-to-teach">Math52</a>.  From the creators of <a href="http://www.mathalicious.com/">Mathalicious</a>, this campaign has set the ambitious goal of raising $164,000 to help transform the way mathematics is taught in our schools.  Every week for a year, they will release a video aimed at exploring mathematics through everyday questions - the types of questions that will immediately connect with students, and help motivate them to understand the math required to provide a reasonable answer.  But don't believe me, check out this video!

The team has raised over $12,000 in a week.  This is amazing, but it's not quite on track for them to reach their goal.  So if you give a hoot, please consider donating to this most worthy of causes.  Even better, if you have some wealthy friends, get them to donate too (friends of Bill Gates, I am speaking to you!).

If you can't spare the change, then please consider spreading the word.  If you're on Twitter, tweet this project to your followers.  If you're on Facebook, share it with your friends.  If you fear technology, deliver messages to your associates via carrier pigeon.  (Though if you fear technology, what are you doing here? Leave now while you still can!)

I apologize for the solicitation, but I would not do it if I did not truly believe in this project.  This approach to teaching and discussing mathematics dovetails quite nicely with what I have been doing on this blog for the past four years, so hopefully you will not be offended by this brief post.

If you'd like to donate, you can do it directly from the link below.  Either way, thanks for reading.
