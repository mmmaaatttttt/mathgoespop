<p>I'd just like to take a moment to remember Jaime Escalante, who <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-jaime-escalante31-2010mar31,0,7083760.story">died</a> today at the age of 79.  I've talked about this East LA math teacher whose antics were given a national stage in the film Stand and Deliver <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/03/math-in-the-movies-stand-and-deliver.html">before</a>, and out of all the films I've seen that try to do justice to mathematics, this one does the best job.  So thanks again, Kimo, for reminding us that skill in mathematics, just as with anthing else worth doing, comes from hard work and dedication.  Although, I'm sure that a cool hat certainly helps.</p>
