Hello friends! In case you haven't heard the news, I released my first book this month. You can order it on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Up-Unlocking-Hidden-Mathematics-Video/dp/0691161518/).

The book started as basically an extension of this blog, though with a narrower focus. While I've tried to use this space to explore the intersection of math and pop culture in general, the book focuses specifically on the search for interesting mathematics inspired by video games.

It's been a labor of love, and part of the reason why my musings over here have dwindled over the past few years. But now that it's out, I'd love for you to read it and let me know what you think! 

I'm proud of how the book turned out, but don't just listen to my biased opinion. Here are some other reviews:

- More reviews, coming soon.

I hope you'll check it out, and if you do, I hope you'll enjoy it.
