<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/verizon/verizon.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 413px; height: 202px;" src="http://xkcd.com/verizon/verizon.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>If you've got the time, and/or the patience, listening to <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/verizon_billing.mp3">this</a> audio clip of <a href="http://verizonmath.blogspot.com/">George Vaccaro</a> try to deal with a series of Verizon representatives who claim that 0.002 = 0.00002 should be enough to strike fear into your heart regarding the future of mathematical literacy in this country.  Then again, he's talking about problems he had while in Canada, so maybe the reps are Canadian.  We'd never make such an obvious mistake here in the States, right?  Right...</p>

<p>On a related note, I would encourage all of you to start writing the dollar amounts on your checks as more complicated mathematical expressions.  Everyone could use a boost to their mathematical literacy, bankers included.</p>

<p>The audio clip is quite long, and the longer it goes on, the more depressing it gets.</p>
