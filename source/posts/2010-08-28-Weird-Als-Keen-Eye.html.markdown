If you follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/alyankovic">Twitter</a> (and really, why wouldn't you?), you may have noticed this picture, which he posted earlier this week along with the tweet "Wow, waffles for just .25 cents?  That means I can get 400 for a dollar!!"
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://twitpic.com/2hsi4b"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-715" title="Picture 6" src="http://www.mathgoespop.com/images/2010/08/Picture-6.png" alt="" width="480" height="416" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kudos to you, Mr. Yankovic, for spotting what I can only assume to be a mathematical error of the type we've seen <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/category/math-fail">before</a>.  If this music thing doesn't pan out, maybe you can work for <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/03/verizon-employees-suck-at-math.html">Verizon</a>.</p>
Then again, maybe it's not an error, in which case I can only hope that Weird Al wastes no time in naming this establishment, so that I can patronize it before they catch wise.

(Thanks to Nate for sending this my way!)
