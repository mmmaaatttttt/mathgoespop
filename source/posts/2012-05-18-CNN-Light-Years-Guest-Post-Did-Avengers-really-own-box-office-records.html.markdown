Over at CNN this month, I talk about the phenomenal success of Marvel's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/">The Avengers</a> in its stampede over old box office records.  But how much stock should we put in these records?  Is this blockbuster really the top dog in the record books?  Here's a sneak preview of the article:
<blockquote>When the Avengers assemble, the world opens its collective wallet.  In just under three weeks since its international opening, "Marvel's The Avengers" has earned more than $1 billion <a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3443&amp;p=.htm">worldwide</a>.  In America, it blew through the $200 million mark over opening weekend alone, and now holds the title of best three-day opening in film history.  Or does it?

While dollar signs fuel the engine of Hollywood movie production, they are not necessarily the most objective measure of a film's success.  Most importantly, the dollar is not a static unit of measurement like the meter; as a result of inflation, a dollar in 2008 has more purchasing power than a dollar in 2012.  If we search for a better way to measure film's opening weekend success, is it possible to dethrone the mighty Avengers?  Let's try to find out.</blockquote>
