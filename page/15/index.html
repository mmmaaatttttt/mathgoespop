  <p>I recently had the pleasure of stumbling across Paul Lockhart's essay, <a href="http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">A Mathematician's Lament</a>.  Lockhart, a former research mathematician in analytic number theory who received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1990, decided to leave academia in 2000 in order to concentrate on K-12 math education, which he hass been doing at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Ann%27s_School_%28New_York_City%29">Saint Ann's School</a> in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Lockhart's article lambasts the current state of mathematics education in this country.  Some of his main points are the following:</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Mathematics is an art form, but unlike other art forms like music or painting, is not understood as such by the general population.  As a result, students are not exposed to the beauty of mathematics, and are instead taught through drill and memorization, which effectively kills any natural curiosity the student may have.</li>
<li>The most important part of mathematics lies not in the facts or theorems that students memorize, but in the <span style="font-style: italic;">arguments</span> that show why these facts must be true.  By stripping away the beauty...</li>

  <p>A friend recently shared with me the following video from <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> (see below).  In it, mathematician (or, in this case, mathemagician) <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/arthur_benjamin.html">Arthur Benjamin</a> gives a brief argument for eliminating calculus as the top of the "mathematical pyramid" in high school education, and replacing it probability and statistics.  The main reason for this shift is that unless you are planning to have a career in a technical field, it's unlikely you'll find a use for calculus in your everyday life, but an understanding of statistics can benefit you no matter what you do.  For example, it can help you to build an intuition about day to day decision making when risk and uncertainty are involved.  Here's the video (it's short, only a couple of minutes):</p>

<p>A noble goal, to be sure, and it's certainly a solution that wouldn't cost a whole lot.  There is an argument to be made for such a change lurking in here somewhere, but coming in at under 3 minutes, Benjamin's argument barely scratches the surface.  In no particular...</p>

  <p>This past week I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959337/">Revolutionary Road</a>, the Oscar nominated 2008 film directed by Sam Mendes.  The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as a highly dysfunctional couple named the Wheelers, who live in 1950s suburban Connecticut.  For those of you who may not have seen this feel-good picture, here's a trailer:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qADM67ZgYxM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>The trailer doesn't address the question of what this film has to do with mathematics.  The answer lies in the character of John Giving, a "mathematician" played in the film by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788335/">Michael Shannon</a> (who turned in an Oscar-nominated performance).</p>

<p>We first hear of John Giving from his mother, who informs Mrs. Wheeler that her son has a brilliant mind, as evidenced by his PhD in mathematics, but that he has been institutionalized, and his doctors have suggested that it would be good for him to go out and make some friends.  This introduction did not bode well for the film's representation of the mathematically inclined, but how did the rest turn out?</p>

  <p>Today marks the 1 year anniversary of Math Goes Pop!  I <a href="http://mathgoespop.blogspot.com/2008/07/all-for-algebra-and-algebra-for-all.html">started</a> on somewhat of a whim after reading an article about compulsory Algebra I education for all California 8th graders (although what with our finances down the toilet, who knows what the current status is here).  When I started writing I wasn't sure there was enough content out there to sustain a blog with this one's focus.  Once I started digging, though, I found that the rabbit hole went quite deep, and so here I am a year later with plenty left to talk about (the recent obsession with <a href="http://mathgoespop.blogspot.com/search/label/Math%20Holidays">pointless math holidays</a> certainly has helped with my output).</p>

<p>Given the date, it seems fitting to begin by mentioning the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday problem</a>.  This is a standard problem given in any introductory probability course, but many people find the result counter intuitive at first.</p>

<p>The birthday problem asks a simple question: if you have a room full of people, how many people do you need so that there's a 50% probability that at least two of them...</p>

  <p>It bothered me when USA Today, in an article celebrating "math holidays" centered on the numerology of certain dates, linked to a <a href="http://mathgoespop.blogspot.com/2009/04/numerology-goes-on-holiday-again.html">post</a> I had written about how these holidays are stupid, without even mentioning my contrary opinion.  However, I was willing to let it slide, since I was able to say that I was linked in an article from USA Today.  Unfortunately, an <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2009-07-07-time-date_N.htm?csp=34">article</a> posted today is just too much.  USA Today, you have officially made it onto my list.</p>

<p>The headline for the article really speaks for itself: "Rare time/date alignment could mean opportunities."  This refers to the fact that in the wee hours of the morning today, it was 4:05:06 on the date 07/08/09.</p>

<p>Money quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="inside-copy">Although the alignment may not mean anything specific, it could be a good day to do something for yourself and others, said Betsy Carlson, a Palm Springs tarot card reader and numerology expert.</p>
<p class="inside-copy">"It's a good day to make money and have good health," she said.</p>

I&#39;ve now discovered that the mastermind behind these so-called math &quot;holidays&quot; is a teacher named Ron Gordon.  Not only was he the one to spearhead the <a href="http://mathgoespop.blogspot.com/2009/05/when-will-this-stop.html">Odd Day</a> initiative 2 months ago, but he&#39;s gone so far as to double dip and call today Odd Day as well, citing the fact that standard date notation for most of the world is DD/MM/YY, rather than MM/DD/YY.</p>

<p>Thanks for double dipping, Mr. Gordon, so that I can read these pointless articles yet again.   Mr. Gordon has even set up a web page and a contest, with cash prizes for those who can celebrate Odd Day the most enthusiastically.  Needless to say, I don&#39;t think I will be the recipient of any such prize.</p>

<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions, Mr. Gordon.  I&#39;m just sayin&#39;.</p>

  <p>I apologize for my silence over the past few weeks - I have been out of the country learning math and eating pancakes.  While I get back into the swing of things, I've got a couple of points to mention that relate to earlier posts regarding our collective inability to correctly use the decimal point.</p>

<p>The first is a picture from a flyer advertising maid service.  Here's the ad (sent in to me by a dedicated foot soldier in the army that is my readership, a.k.a. my mother):</p>

<p>Although we've seen decimal point errors on signs <a href="http://mathgoespop.blogspot.com/2009/06/cheapest-salad-bar-in-world.html">before</a>, this one is arguably the most egregious of all.  Presumably the intended price is $100 - if that's the case, then not only is the decimal point in the wrong place, it's not even necessary.  It's hard to imagine how this mistake could've been made and then gone unchecked, but if you live in San Francisco and are looking for some...</p>

  <p>Math has gotten a bit of a visibility boost recently, in the form of posts by professor <a href="http://tam.cornell.edu/faculty-bio.cfm?NetID=shs7">Steven Strogatz</a> at the New York Times blog.  For three weeks, starting at the end of May, Professor Strogatz filled in for usual blogger <a href="http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/">Olivia Judson</a>, and during that time he used the platform to write some highly readable musings that show the presence of mathematics in unlikely places, and touch on some of the directions math is headed in the 21st century.</p>

<p>Let me highlight the first post, titled "<a href="http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/math-and-the-city/">Math and the City</a>."  Professor Strogatz begins this article by describing Zipf's law, an observation attributed to linguist George Zipf regarding the distribution of words in a language (for a linguistic motivation, you can check the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf's law</a>).</p>

  <p>Last week, I went to a number theory conference in Utah.  The conference was very good, and I learned quite a lot, which I suppose is the goal of any such conference.  The location of the conference itself was also quite nice - it was close to the mountains, a lake, and the home of Blendtec, famous for their "Will it Blend" series of videos.</p>

<p>As you might expect, most of what I learned on this conference pertained to number theory.  However, there were lessons outside of this sphere of knowledge as well.  The one lesson I will share with you is best encapsulated in this picture:</p>

<p>It was my friend Jack who pointed out the placement of the decimal point.

  <p>As many of you are no doubt aware, Pixar's latest film opens this weekend.  I have yet to see the film, so I'm sure I am spoiling nothing by telling you that part of the film involves an old man flying through the sky by means of balloons that are attached to his house.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fM0L9abY3bo/SiHgaV9rgvI/AAAAAAAAAOw/O9iagpm0hck/s1600-h/up-pixar-poster.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 216px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fM0L9abY3bo/SiHgaV9rgvI/AAAAAAAAAOw/O9iagpm0hck/s320/up-pixar-poster.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><span style="font-size:78%;">Do not try this <del>at</del> with your home.</span>
</div>

<p>Given that I have yet to see the film, you may wonder how I could possibly hope to connect it to mathematics.  Thankfully, I don't have to - the work has been done for me by Alexis Madrigal over at Wired.com, who wrote an <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/05/how-pixars-up-house-could-really-fly/">article</a> discussing the feasibility of using balloons to take to the skies in one's own home.</p>

<p>His assumptions are that the house weighs roughly 100,000 pounds, and that the balloons are spherically shaped with a diameter of three feet, which may seem large at first, but seems more reasonable if you look at other shots of the floating house.</p>
