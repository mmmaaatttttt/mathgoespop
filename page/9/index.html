  <p>Last week we <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2010/12/humanities.html">discussed</a> an example of when a mathematical background might prove useful even in the least quantitative of liberal arts courses.  More specifically, we asked the question: if a teacher gives you a list of <em>N</em> questions, tells you that <em>M</em> will be on an exam, and you must answer <em>K</em> of the questions given on the exam, what's the minimum number of questions you should prepare to guarantee that you will be able to answer <em>K</em> of the questions on the exam?  (Answer: <em>N + K – M.</em>)<em> </em>We also looked at the question probabilistically - namely, we saw that of the questions appearing on the exam, the number that you've prepared for follows a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution">hypergeometric distribution</a>.</p>

<p>As a concrete example I considered the case <em>N</em> = 6, <em>M</em> = 5, <em>K = </em>3 - in this case, the minimum number of questions you should prepare to guarantee that you can answer 3 of 5 problems on the exam is 4, and we saw that if you only prepare 3 questions, you have a 50% chance of those 3 questions appearing on the list of 5.</p>

  <p>Unless you're one of those suckers who goes to a school that administers final exams after the holidays (like I was), the few weeks after Thanksgiving can be quite a stressful time for students.  Between exams, final papers, and working out holiday travel plans, it can be easy to get overwhelmed.  For students with a quantitative bent, the days are undoubtedly spent in large part trying to memorize formulas or theorems, or on refining their understanding of certain problem-solving techniques that have been covered in their courses.</p>

<p>If your interests are more in line with the humanities, you may think that you are safe from the pull of mathematics.  There are occasions, though, when a working knowledge of mathematics can help even in a liberal arts course.</p>

  <p>A couple of days ago I watched a video that really depressed me.  <a href="http://www.kcci.com/r/25845894/detail.html">Here</a>'s a link to a local news story from Ankeny, Iowa - I'd encourage you to take a look at the news clip there (unfortunately, I can't embed it here).  The story concerns a 6th grade student who has memorized the decimal expansion of pi to 340 or so digits.</p>

<p>In and of itself, this might not seem like a particularly newsworthy achievement - as any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day">Pi Day</a> aficionado can tell you, there are people who have memorized more digits.  Perhaps what makes it newsworthy is the fact that the student is only twelve years old, or, more perversely, the fact that his accomplishment came in response to the challenge of his math teacher, who asked his students to memorize as many digits of pi as possible.  By far the most depressing part of the video is a brief clip that shows all the students in the classroom mindlessly rattling off successive digits of pi.  The lack of enthusiasm is almost palpable.</p>

  <p>Earlier this month, Oakland elected its first Asian American to the less than coveted role of city mayor.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Quan">Jean Quan</a> emerged victorious this election day, although at one point she was trailing her opponent by 11 percentage points.  Understood in context, however, her victory is perhaps less surprising - rather than winning by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting_system">Plurality</a>, Quan won under Oakland's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">Instant Runoff Voting</a> system.</p>

<p>What's the difference?  For most elections in the United States, voters are instructed to cast their vote for the individual who they would most like to see get elected.  These votes are tallied, and the one with the most votes is declared the winner.  In contrast, the Instant Runoff Voting system asks voters to rank several candidates at once - this extra information is used to automatically determine the outcome of a runoff if no candidate has a majority of first choice votes.</p>

  <p>A couple of weeks ago, the Washington Post ran an op-ed written by G. V. Ramanathan, emeritus Professor in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, entitled "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/22/AR2010102205451.html">How much math do we really need</a>?"  As the title suggests, Ramanathan uses his space in the paper to argue against the grain of conventional wisdom when it comes to mathematics education; his point is that American students are actually receiving too MUCH math, rather than not enough.  It's an appealing thesis, especially for those looking for an excuse to embrace their own math phobia, but ultimately I find it to be less than responsible.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, the following passage:
</p><blockquote>How much math do you really need in everyday life? Ask yourself that  -- and also the next 10 people you meet, say, your plumber, your lawyer,  your grocer, your mechanic, your physician or even a math teacher.

<p>Unlike literature, history, politics and music, math has little  relevance to everyday life. That courses such as "Quantitative  Reasoning...</p>

  <p>Now that the World Series is upon is, I thought I might take a moment to discuss the latest results in the field of optimal base running.  On the face of it, this may seem like a non-issue; after all, as any decent student of geometry will tell you, the shortest distance between any two plates is a straight line.</p>

<p>In a game of baseball, however, it's more important to minimize time, not distance.  Given this, running a path that consists of four straight lines connecting each base is not optimal, because the runner must slow down to make the sharp turns at each base.  Of course, baseball players already know this, which is why they often swing out in their path before crossing first when they are confident that they can reach second or more.  But still, the question remains: are these trajectories optimal?</p>

<p>According to a trio of mathematicians from <a href="http://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a>, maybe not.  According to an article originally posted in <a href="http://www.livescience.com/culture/baseball-running-bases-curved-path-100530.html">May</a>, but which only now seems to be gaining some <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/index/generic/activity/view/id/64589/title/Math_Trek__Winning_the_World_Series_with_math">traction</a>, recent...</p>

  <p>It has already made the internet rounds, but it seems appropriate, given his popular appeal, to remark on the passing of mathematician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno%C3%AEt_Mandelbrot">Benoît Mandelbrot</a>.  Mandelbrot, perhaps best well known for coining the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal</a> (and for his related popular work on the subject), died last week at the age of 85.</p>

<p>Mandelbrot's popularization of fractal geometry garnered him quite a bit of attention beginning in the 1980's.  There is even a fractal named after him, the so-called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot set</a>," which, like many fractals, is simple to generate, but looks complicated.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Mandel_zoom_00_mandelbrot_set.jpg/800px-Mandel_zoom_00_mandelbrot_set.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Mandel_zoom_00_mandelbrot_set.jpg/800px-Mandel_zoom_00_mandelbrot_set.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300"></a></center>

<p>It's no coincidence that popularity in fractals rose in step with advancing computer technology.  Without computers to perform the tedious calculations necessary for fractal generation (and by extension, to output all the pretty pictures), the field received much less attention.  Contrary to popular belief, though, Mandelbrot was not the first to consider these ideas - indeed, many properties of fractal sets called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Julia sets</a>"...</p>

  <p>Another year, another night of dressing in costumes on a quest for candy and/or debauchery.  In previous years, I've tried to encourage mathematically influenced Halloween costumes (see <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/10/math-goes-trick-or-treating-again.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2008/10/math-goes-trick-or-treating.html">here</a>), and so if for no other reason than the sake of consistency, this year will be no different.  Here are some new ideas for 2010:</p>

<p><strong>1. The Count</strong></p>

<p>This costume idea was suggested to me in the comments section of last year's list.  Known and loved by children and adults alike, this costume would give the wearer ample opportunity to teach children about the wonders of math.  If you're one of those people who give out pennies or toothbrushes, though, I would caution you against this costume decision, since the combination of a lack of candy and an insistence on discussing mathematics may dramatically increase the likelihood of you being at the receiving end of a "trick."</p>

  <p>Last week, my friend <a href="http://foodjunta.com/author/jonathan/">Jon</a> forwarded me this <a href="http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2010/09/16/the-math-behind-96-million-burger-choices/">article</a> posted on CNN's Eatocracy blog.  In it, writer Laurie Segall describes the number of possible burger combinations at a restaurant in New York City called <a href="http://4food.com/">4food</a>.  Using some elementary combinatorics and the brain power of her statistician husband, together they calculated that the number of possible burgers one could order at 4food is 1,598,238,720.  This is assuming that one follows the rules of the restaurant; if you want the option of including all 12 condiments on your burger, rather than sticking to the suggested limit of 0-3, and similarly for the cheese options, the number of combinations jumps to 96,639,764,160 (roughly a 60-fold increase).</p>

<p>This reminded me of a similar calculation I had been meaning to do for the chain of hamburger restaurants called <a href="http://www.thecounterburger.com/">The Counter</a>.  Founded in Los Angeles in 2003, The Counter has since branched out across the country, and has even gone international with locations in Ireland and Australia.  And...</p>

  <p>When I first started this blog, there were a handful of movies that seemed natural to discuss.  <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2008/08/math-in-the-movies-good-will-hunting.html">Good Will Hunting</a> was my first foray into this group, and was followed by <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2008/12/math-in-the-movies-pi.html">Pi</a>, and later <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/03/math-in-the-movies-stand-and-deliver.html">Stand and Deliver</a>.  While I have discussed other movies in between, these three are in a class of their own due to the fact that they revolve so centrally around mathematics.  There are a couple of notable exceptions on this list, a regrettable fact which I am in the process of correcting.  Case in point: today I'd like to take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_%28film%29">A Beautiful Mind</a>.</p>

<p>More successful than any of the three previous films I listed (from a box office standpoint, mind you, not necessarily a mathematical one), Ron Howard's 2001 biopic of mathematician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.">John Nash</a> won four Academy Awards, including the coveted Best Picture and Best Directing trophies.  I saw the film when it came out, but didn't remember much, except for being underwhelmed, and so it was with low expectations that I decided to rewatch the film this weekend...</p>
