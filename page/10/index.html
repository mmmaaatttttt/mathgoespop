  <p>If you went to the movies in Los Angeles this summer, you may have seen the following ad from <a href="https://www.standup2cancer.org/Default.aspx">Stand Up to Cancer</a>, a charitable program whose telethon aired last Friday night.  A clear homage to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterCard">MasterCard</a>'s long-running Priceless campaign, this ad swaps out prices for odds, ending with the sobering fact that 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will be diagnosed with some type of cancer in their lifetime.</p>

</p><p>Presumably, those cancer odds are taken from The American Cancer society, which has the relevant stats posted <a href="http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerBasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer">here</a>.  When it comes to some of the other claims in the ad, though, I couldn't help but be skeptical.</p>

<p>Take the bowling claim, for instance.  This ad would have you believe that your odds of bowling a perfect game are 1 in 11,500.  This seems quite high, even when I consider the fact that I am not a bowling master.</p>

<p>Let's try to reverse-engineer this statistic.  To score a perfect game in bowling, one must bowl 12 strikes in a row.  Let us suppose that your probability of bowling...</p>

  <p>Late last month, Slate ran an interesting article analyzing the performance of 3D movies over the past six years.  Titled "<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2264927/pagenum/all/">Is 3-D Dead in the Water?</a>", the article investigated the success of a 3D film by looking at several films released in 3D and graphing the ratio of their opening weekend revenue from 3D screenings to their opening weekend revenue from 2D screenings.  There's a lot of good stuff in the article leading up to this, but the main point is given by the following graph:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size:small;"><a href="http://img.slate.com/media/4/100824_CB_chart3.jpg"><img src="http://img.slate.com/media/4/100824_CB_chart3.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="334"></a><br>Image courtesy of Slate - click the link above to see the original article.</p>

<p>This graph tells you, for example, that during opening weekend for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338348/">The Polar Express</a> in 2004, the screens showing the film in 3D made nearly 7 times as much money as the screens showing the film in 2D.  As you can see, the drop from this film is quite precipitous, and among recent films, it looks as though 3D and 2D versions of a 3D film are making around the same amount of money.  Given the extra effort involved in making a film...</p>

  <p>More than three weeks after its opening, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/">Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</a> appears to be limping towards the end of its theatrical run.  For whatever <a href="cle/scott-pilgrim-vs-box-office-how-something-so-good-did-so-bad-20335?page=0,0">reason</a> (some blame marketing, others blame Michael Cera exhaustion, for others the fault lies with a crowded weekend of opening releases) this action comedy with a video game aesthetic and a heart of platinum has failed to find an audience.  Critical response has been very positive, and everyone I know who's seen the film has enjoyed it, so it's unfortunate that this level of support hasn't translated into higher revenues.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><object width="560" height="349"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/A1qaLmfzW3I?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0">

<p>While I'm sure many people have their own explanations for why this film didn't resonate with a larger crowd, I would like to posit my own: that our culture's math anxiety runs so deep, we instinctively run when there's even a hint of mathematics afoot.  For if you look closely enough, you can find some mathematics in this film.</p>

<p>Kudos to you, Mr. Yankovic, for spotting what I can only assume to be a mathematical error of the type we've seen <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/category/math-fail">before</a>.  If this music thing doesn't pan out, maybe you can work for <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/03/verizon-employees-suck-at-math.html">Verizon</a>.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe it&#39;s not an error, in which case I can only hope that Weird Al wastes no time in naming this establishment, so that I can patronize it before they catch wise.</p>

  <p>In case you missed it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama">Futurama</a> was recently resurrected from beyond the television grave, and this summer it began airing new half-hour episodes on Comedy Central.  Although it's never reached the height of popularity achieved by its older sibling, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, Futurama nevertheless has its own share of dedicated fans.  Many of those fans appreciate the differences between this show and The Simpsons, the most obvious of which is the former's futuristic setting and sci-fi influences.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Futurama_title_screen.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Futurama_title_screen.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="270"></a></p>

<p>The setting of the show naturally lends itself to math and science jokes, and in this department Futurama does not disappoint.  Last week, however, they seriously stepped their game up a notch, by featuring the proof of an original mathematical result as a central feature in the plot of the story.</p>

<p>The mathematics evolves quite organically.  In the show, Amy and Professor Farnsworth have created a mind-switching device, which can swap the minds of any two individuals.  After a brief discussion, they...</p>

  <p>It's rare for mathematical research to break into the mainstream media.  New papers are posted on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> every day, and published in journals all over the world throughout the year, but unless a famous problem is purported to have been solved (in this case, a famous problem is usually one that has a cash prize associated with its solution), knowledge of such advances is only found by those specifically seeking it.  Last week, however, there an exception to this general rule was made for a new result concerning the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube">Rubik's cube</a>.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Rubik%27s_cube.svg/500px-Rubik%27s_cube.svg.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Rubik%27s_cube.svg/500px-Rubik%27s_cube.svg.png" alt="" width="400" height="416"></a></center>

<p>The conclusion, reached by an international team of mathematicians, is that the Rubik's cube can always be solved in 20 moves or less, and that, moreover, their result is in some sense the best possible.  This result was featured on the front page of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100813/od_afp/ussciencerubikoffbeat">Yahoo News</a> for a couple of days, which I found surprising.</p>

<p>What do I mean by "best possible"?  Well, since 1995 it's been known that the minimum number of moves needed to solve a Rubik's cube is <em>at least</em> 20...</p>

  <p>Last weekend I went to the Pasadena Flea Market, <a href="http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/RoseBowl_flea-market.htm">self-described</a> as &quot;one of the most famous markets in the world.&quot;  I had not anticipated on finding anything math related, and although I did stumble across an old adding machine, the most surprising find was what greeted me at the door.</p>

<p><center><a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/images/2010/08/protractors.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-638" title="protractors" src="http://www.mathgoespop.com/images/2010/08/protractors-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="560" /></a></center></p>

<p>R.G. Canning <a href="http://www.rgcshows.com/">produces</a> the flea market every month, but I have no idea why they were giving away protractors.  There&#39;s furniture for sale, but I would think rulers would be the preferred measuring device when browsing through such items.  Perhaps instead they thought that August would be a good month to get rid of a surplus of protractors, with back to school around the corner?  Whatever the case, kudos to R.G. Canning attractions for their protractor giveaway bonanza.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m not sure how many protractors were actually taken.  Unfortunately, most people didn&#39;t seem interested.  Their loss, I suppose.</p>

  <p>Late last month there was apparently a bit of a ruckus over whether or not California should adopt new national education standards as part of a competition among the states dubbed "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_Top">Race to the Top.</a>"</p>

<p>Although Race to the Top (the brain child of education secretary Arne Duncan) hasn't received much media attention, it was one of the many byproducts of last year's economic stimulus act.  Recently, though, it's been the subject of more discussion - a relatively detailed <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/mcclatchy/20100808/pl_mcclatchy/3585264">article</a> on the program was published over the weekend, for example.</p>

<p>For Californians (and residents of other states, I'm sure), participation in Race to the Top has been met with some controversy.  The latest debate, as I mentioned above, has been about education standards.  Race to the Top comes with its own set of national education standards, and adopting those standards helps a state's odds of winning some federal education funding.  Ergo, the California State Board of Education had to vote on whether or not to adopt...</p>

  <p>If you like food, Washington DC, hubris, or reality television, then chances are you are a fan of Bravo's cooking competition <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Chef">Top Chef</a>.  Every year the show takes a group of aspiring chefs, places them in a house in a new city, and throws weekly challenges their way.  Following the Survivor template, every week one chef is voted off, and at the end someone is crowned Top Chef (and given a large check).  This season, the action takes place in our nation's capitol.</p>

<p>Now, a show such as this might seem to have very little to do with mathematics.  But look, and ye shall find.  In the second episode of this past season, the chefs were paired up for one of the challenges.  There were 16 chefs at the time, combining to make 8 pairs.  The pairing was determined by drawing knives: 16 knives were presented in a knife block, and each had a number on it from 1 to 8.  The number was printed on the blade, so each chef would walk to the block, draw a knife, and read the number.  The knives were not...</p>

  <p>Some time ago, I heard about a book from Japan called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Housekeeper_and_the_Professor">The Housekeeper and the Professor</a>, written by Yoko Ogawa in 2003 and translated by Stephen Snyder last year.  As the title suggests, the book centers on the relationship between a housekeeper, her son, and a math professor.  The main conceit of the book is that the Professor suffered an accident some years before that impaired his memory, so that his short term memory only lasts around 80 minutes.  In other words, every day the housekeeper and her son come to visit the professor, it is as if they are meeting him for the first time.  He copes by clipping small notes to his clothing, and in spite of his disability he still dabbles in mathematics. </p>
